## Clean Code & Good Documentation

- Code follows PEP-8
- Make sure to add doc strings to all your functions
- Very informative README.md, text for the images are a tad small to read

## Proper Data Science:

- Because 31 dimensions are not too too many, consider using simpler dim reduction or extraction methods
- Consider using neural networks with larger data sets. Might be a better application for project 5 or if you have time to collect more data. 

## Comments:

- Great job on project 3, loved how you tried to combine multiple techniques. More of a learning process than actually finding better results. 
  Consider checking with an instructor to see if these methods make sense(or they can provide a different direction  before diving in.
